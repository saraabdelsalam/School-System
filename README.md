## üõ†Ô∏è Project Components

- **CQRS Design Pattern & MediatR**  
  Implemented CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with **MediatR** for a clear separation between read and write operations.

- **Generic Repository Pattern**  
  Built a flexible and reusable data access layer using the **Generic Repository** pattern.

- **Pagination Schema**  
  Integrated pagination for handling large datasets efficiently.

- **Fluent Validations & Custom Error Handling**  
  Used **FluentValidation** for request validations along with centralized and custom error handling middleware.

- **Entity Configurations Using Data Annotations**  
  Applied simple validation and database schema rules directly on models with **Data Annotations**.

- **Entity Configurations Using Fluent API**  
  Handled complex configurations using **Fluent API** inside `DbContext`.

- **Endpoints of Operations**  
  Provided a complete set of CRUD APIs to manage school-related data.

- **CORS Policy Setup**  
  Configured **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow access from specified clients.

- **Identity Integration**  
  Integrated **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user management (registration, login, password hashing, etc.).

- **Authentication**  
  Added **JWT-based Authentication** for securing the API endpoints.

- **Authorization (Roles & Claims)**  
  Implemented **Role-Based** and **Claims-Based** Authorization to control access based on user permissions.
